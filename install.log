Python build finished successfully!
The necessary bits to build these optional modules were not found:
ossaudiodev           spwd                                     
To find the necessary bits, look in setup.py in detect_modules() for the module's name.

The following modules found by detect_modules() in setup.py, have been
built by the Makefile instead, as configured by the Setup files:
